# InteractiveQuiz

This is a dynamic, timed quiz application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project focuses on core frontend development knowledge and is designed to provide users with an engaging, interactive challenge and immediate performance feedback.

Key Features ------------
The application incorporates several modern features to enhance the user experience. Each question is automatically timed for ten seconds to introduce a sense of urgency. If a user does not submit an answer before the timer runs out, the question is automatically registered as unanswered. The user is kept informed of their advancement through the quiz via a visual progress bar that updates as questions are answered. Smooth and professional screen transitions, question changes, and score displays are powered by the GSAP (GreenSock) animation library. A theme switcher allows users to easily toggle between a light and dark color scheme for personalized viewing. Utilizing Tailwind CSS utility classes, the interface is fully responsive and maintains a clean, modern layout across all major device sizes. Upon completion, the application displays the final score and provides a comprehensive breakdown of every question, indicating whether the user's answer was correct and showing the correct answer for all missed questions. Finally, answer options are shuffled for every question presentation to ensure quiz integrity and prevent answer memorization bias.
